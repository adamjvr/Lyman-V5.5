# Lyman-V5.5
A Redistribution of the Lyman-Mulier V5 Filament Extruder by Adam Vadala-Roth &amp; Michael Perrone @ WorcLab

Change Log of Differences From V5:
- 
Some things we should add to our redesign

The washers in the wheel assembly are loose: need to make it a tighter fit

The auger stand could use some 3D printed legs which glue onto the current print so it's about 1cm higher
The coupling between the auger and the motor is poor/oversized (we may just want to check one more time that we do indeed have the right motors)
The spool does not rotate with the dowel: we may want to make the cylinders have an adjustable diameter
The standard 1kg spool is too narrow. The larger printed spool is the right diameter

double the length of the 1/4-20 boltsget the auger
Add slightly more ID to the small pulley, round the end of the connector so it doesn't hit the bolts

Add 1.4-1.6 mm inset to auger-motor coupling on both sides
Modify spool stand to have sunk nut so that it doesn’t trap the spool from rotating when using 
add chamfer to filament puller coupling
adjust pulley ID: still needs to be slightly larger ID: first correction wasn’t enough, needs like 125 microns more diameter
fix big motor coupling looseness

Add 1.6 mm to diameter of spool holder things, keep undersize ones for those who want to adjust with tape

Add 5mm height to extruder section: just print a block of plastic as a spacer?
Then add ¾ inch thick wood or plastic under the pawl assembly maybe. Simple optional block or wood parts. Could add screw holes accordingly
